        Integrate JMeter non-functional tests with CI/CD server

      </h3>
      <p>
        JMeter is a great non-functional testing tool. However, on its own, it
        struggles in two particular areas: automatic analysis of aggregated
        performance characteristics and integration with CI/CD servers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lightning integrates JMeter non-functional tests with your CI/CD server.
        It analyses results of your JMeter tests and provides your server with
        unequivocal information allowing it to make autonomous decision whether
        to pass or fail the build - with no human involvement needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lightning is available as a standalone JAR, AWS Lambda function, Gradle
        and Maven plugins. All versions accept same input and provide the same
        functionality. Format of the input and output will vary. You can use the
        one you prefer.
      </p>

        >Why Lightning
      </h3>

      <p>Benefits of using Lightning include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Lightning allows you to make a decision on performance build results,
          based on very broad range of client-side statistics. This is much more
          than just average response times. You can measure: throughput, median
          response time, maximum response time, n-th percentile response time,
          response time standard deviation and percentage of failed
          transactions. Learn more about available
          <a href="test_types.html" target="_blank">test types</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
          There is no need to configure anything on CI/CD server to run the
          above tests. You can have your first Lightning test running in
          minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
          Lightning understands you may have different SLA for different
          transactions types and allows you to define different thresholds for
          every transaction type.
        </li>

        <li>
          Lightning is not only about client-side statistics. It also gives you
          ability to measure
          <a href="server_side_tests.html" target="_blank"
            >server-side metrics</a
          >
          (CPU, memory, network usage etc) and fail the build if certain metrics
          go above defined threshold. Or below. Your JMeter tests are no longer
          pure performance tests, they are now powerful non-functional tests.
          This lets you test load balancing and other non-functional
          characteristics of your system.
        </li>

        <li>
          No disk space considerations - there is no need for extremely verbose
          JMeter results in XML format. Lightning processes JMeter results in
          <a href="jmeter_configuration.html" target="_blank">CSV format</a>
          with just a few columns.
        </li>

        <li>
          No security concerns - your data is not uploaded to any 3rd party
          servers.
        </li>

        <li>
          Lightning integrates seamlessly with CI/CD servers using "language"
          which they understand -
          <a href="ci_cd_server_integration.html" target="_blank"
            >exit code and JUnit XML report</a
          >.
        </li>

        <li>
          Lightning is open source and free for commercial and non-commercial
          use.
        </li>

        <li>
          If you use
          <a href="enhanced_jenkins_integration.html" target="_blank">Jenkins</a
          >, you can set the build name to something more meaningful than the
          defaults. Build name can now include number of passed and failed
          tests.
        </li>

        <li>
          If you use
          <a href="enhanced_teamcity_integration.html" target="_blank"
            >TeamCity</a
          >, you will benefit from build statistics charts.
        </li>

        <li>
          If all you need is number of executed an failed JMeter transactions,
          Lightning can check that for you
          <a href="report_mode.html" target="_blank">as well</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
